Specifically, this SoK proposes a taxonomy to classify existing DeAI protocols based on the model lifecycle, providing a critical and systematic understanding of the current landscape of DeAI protocols, and identifying their similarities and differences. Most importantly, this work explores where DeAI is today and where it could go next.</p><p>The rapid rise of AI is transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. But along with these incredible benefits come real concerns about the centralization of AI. Centralization makes AI systems vulnerable to technical disruptions, embeds biases from controlling entities, and limits scalability and innovation due to processing bottlenecks and lack of diversity. When only a handful of entities have the resources to train advanced models, it stifles broader advancements in the AI space.</p><p>To address these challenges, DeAI has emerged as a promising solution that leverages the strengths of both blockchain and AI. Blockchain technology offers transparency, security, and decentralization, significantly enhancing the trustworthiness of AI systems. By integrating blockchain with AI, it is possible to create a more robust and decentralized ecosystem that addresses key issues like data privacy, model integrity, and equitable access to AI resources.</p><h3><strong>Lifecycle Phases of Decentralized AI</strong></h3><p>To this end, we propose a framework to ensure that AI processes are traceable and decentralized throughout their lifecycle. As shown in Figure 1, the lifecycle of a DeAI application consists of four phases: task-proposing, pre-training, training, post-training, and a feedback loop that may return to task proposal for model refining or fine-tuning. In addition, Table 1 summarizes almost 50 DeAI industry projects which are surveyed in our SoK. This, as well as other DeAI-related materials covered in the paper, are all now publicly available in this <a href="https://github.com/FLock-io/awesome-decentralized-ai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github repository</a>.</p><p><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf2ECWHyK8-5go-qpt9tbHblbMbqf6GsmrIOl34Z7CADMlXBA6ryU7qNy3V8M_YNa3tyjfOI1cdx2miZdo4cTNBn2q2fT7upXgV1TdZaLQmvFrkzC1Lp-C1gt_lfIrjPXw08iYLXA?key=VUMZpieOtEd4sofrJzuCpgAL" height="421" width="602"></p><p class="ql-align-center"><em>Figure1: A DeAI model lifecycle</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4><strong><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXchC_1aHqKbIFCrwkN3pq7U8FCkZjY4--dBKaQriAZ3cq1-GFt8qlPMGHQXrAFuFC-XHmWvbw6tR1ZScsApxfc1v5IzyyuwZoKgDJ4zr34gKSj2C8xLE6bkTOlqtVwBYSwTbCJj?key=VUMZpieOtEd4sofrJzuCpgAL" height="603" width="602"></strong></h4><h4 class="ql-align-center"><em>Table1: Overview of DeAI Projects.</em></h4><h3><strong>Pre-Training Phase</strong></h3><p>The pre-training phase generally comprises two stages: data preparation and compute.</p><h4>Data Preparation</h4><p>Data preparation involves processes such as data collection, cleaning, normalization, transformation, and feature selection. Recent analyses suggest that we are nearing the limit of available data for future models. This highlights critical challenges for centralized AI: data saturation, underrepresentation across domains, languages, and regions, and increasing privacy concerns that hinder access to domain-specific datasets. Decentralized AI offers a solution by enabling the use of diverse, domain-specific datasets while respecting data privacy, ultimately enhancing model robustness, scalability, and reducing biases.</p><p><strong>Incentive Mechanisms for Data Contributions:</strong> Decentralized data preparation platforms often use blockchain-based reward mechanisms to incentivize high-quality data contributions. Platforms like Ocean Protocol and Vana tokenize data assets, allowing data providers to publish datasets as datatokens, which data consumers can purchase, creating a market-driven approach. Proof-of-contribution mechanisms assess data quality and assign scores, linking rewards to meaningful data contributions. Additionally, stake and reputation-based systems, such as those used in Fraction AI, reward contributors based on the quality of their work and their corresponding on-chain reputation, promoting high standards and accountability.</p><p><strong>Data Privacy Protection:</strong> Privacy-enhancing technologies like public encryption and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are often employed to protect the privacy of data contributors in decentralized data preparation platforms. For instance, Vana uses ZKPs, such as Groth16, to verify the authenticity and integrity of data without revealing its full content. Similarly, Ocean Protocol employs encryption and blockchain-based access control mechanisms to protect data privacy, using NFTs as keys to unlock datasets, with smart contracts enforcing these access controls.</p><h4><strong>Compute</strong></h4><p>Compute resources play a pivotal role in the development of AI systems and directly impact model training and inference performance. Blockchain enables permissionless access to compute resources by allowing compute users and providers to interact without intermediaries like traditional cloud service providers. This creates a distributed network where anyone with idle hardware can contribute compute power, enhancing decentralization and making high-performance compute available for AI tasks. Platforms like Lilypad leverage blockchain to enable containerized workloads on idle compute nodes, promoting an open and accessible compute environment.</p><p><strong>Incentives and Integrity in Compute Networks:</strong> Blockchain-based compute networks use incentive mechanisms to ensure efficient resource utilization. Tokenized economies, such as those in IO.NET and Akash, allow compute providers to monetize idle resources and enable users to access high-performance compute at competitive, market-driven prices. The transparency of blockchain ensures integrity and reliability by recording every task on-chain. With consensus mechanisms like proof-of-learning, blockchain-enabled DeAI protocols like Gensyn ensure that tasks are honestly executed and compute providers are fairly rewarded.</p><h3><strong>Training Phase</strong></h3><p>In the training phase, blockchain plays an equally important role in decentralizing AI processes:</p><p><strong>Trustless Environment and Decentralized Training:</strong> Blockchain enables a trustless environment where participants do not need to rely on a central authority. All interactionsâ€”such as task assignments, model updates, and reward distributionsâ€”are recorded on an immutable ledger, ensuring transparency. Bittensor, for instance, encodes the rules governing the training process and record participant contributions on-chain, while Numerai provides a decentralized data science competition that promotes global collaboration without centralized oversight.</p><p><strong>Decentralized Model Validation:</strong> Model updates are validated in a distributed manner. Validators within the blockchain network verify the correctness of these updates, ensuring that malicious or low-quality contributions do not negatively impact the system. Numerai, for example, aggregates independently trained models into a meta-model, evaluating performance based on individual contributions to ensure overall system integrity.</p><p><strong>Consensus and Incentive Mechanisms:</strong> Blockchain-based training employs consensus and incentive mechanisms to reward participants for high-quality contributions. Bittensor's Yuma Consensus allocates rewards to miners and validators based on their contributions, while FLock uses staking to reward participants proportionally to their performance. These mechanisms encourage participants to develop reliable and effective models, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.</p><h3><strong>Post-Training Phase</strong></h3><h4>Decentralized Model Inference</h4><p>In traditional AI systems, model inference involves deploying a trained model on centralized servers to make predictions or decisions based on new input data. This centralized approach faces challenges related to information inefficiency and inference integrity. Blockchain-based decentralized model inference addresses these challenges by offering transparent and verifiable inference processes.</p><p><strong>Decentralized Inference Verification:</strong> Two main approaches are used for inference verificationâ€”ZKP-based and optimistic proof-based verification. ZKP-based inference, like Sertn, allows participants to prove that an inference was conducted correctly without revealing underlying details, ensuring privacy while maintaining trust. Optimistic proof-based inference, such as ORA, operates under the assumption that results are correct unless challenged, incorporating an interactive fraud-proof protocol to resolve disputes.</p><p><strong>Incentive Mechanisms for Reliable Inference:</strong> Incentive mechanisms, such as those used in Allora, encourage network participation by rewarding nodes for producing high-quality inferences and validating the work performed by others. This improves information exchange efficiency and ensures reliable inference outcomes.</p><h4>Decentralized AI Agents</h4><p>Blockchain-based decentralized agents present a promising solution to the challenges faced by traditional AI agents. By operating in a decentralized environment, these agents eliminate reliance on centralized infrastructure. Platforms like Fetch.AI enable the creation of autonomous economic agents that interact within an Open Economic Framework (OEF), facilitating efficient transactions without central control. Similarly, Delysium and Theoriq ensure secure communication, auditability, and the ability to collaborate on complex tasks.</p><p><strong>Trust, Transparency, and Incentives for Decentralized Agents:</strong> Blockchain also enhances trust and transparency in decentralized agent interactions. By recording actions on-chain, agents can trust that their behaviors and agreements will be executed as predefined without third-party intermediaries. Incentive mechanisms are key to fostering collaboration among decentralized agents. Protocols like Morpheus use token-based incentive models to motivate agents to contribute resources, data, or computational power. This encourages agents to collaborate on complex tasks and innovate, ultimately improving system efficiency.</p><h4>Decentralized AI Model Marketplace</h4><p>Blockchain-based AI model marketplaces address challenges such as unfair compensation and lack of transparency. Traditional marketplaces often fail to fairly compensate model creators and use undisclosed algorithms for ranking models. Blockchain helps address these issues by enabling decentralization, transparency, and fair incentivization for contributors.</p><p><strong>Tokenization of AI Assets and Fair Incentives:</strong> Blockchain tokenization allows AI assets, including models and datasets, to be represented as digital tokens, which can be traded or licensed with transparent ownership and secure provenance. Projects like BalanceDAO and SingularityNET empower model contributors by providing fair compensation through token-based rewards, ensuring that model creators are directly rewarded for their contributions. Similarly, the Sahara AI Marketplace also creates a decentralized hub for trading AI assets, ensuring rewards are distributed fairly.</p><p><strong>Transparent Ranking and Trustworthy Ownership:</strong> Transparent ranking algorithms are another benefit of decentralized AI marketplaces. Platforms like Immutable Labs use blockchain-based models to provide fair model rankings and recommendations, ensuring contributors are presented transparently based on performance and reputation. Sahara AI enhances transparency by using non-fungible receipts as on-chain proof of AI model ownership, countering traditional biases and building trust in the marketplace.</p><h3><strong>Open Research Questions for DeAI</strong></h3><p>DeAI is still in its nascent stage, and despite significant efforts from the industry, we still have a long way to go. Thus, in the SoK, we further explore additional open research questions with the hope of contributing to DeAI's future, both in terms of research as well as its application:</p><ul><li><strong>Decentralized Solutions for Task Proposing</strong>: Although task proposing marks the beginning of an AI modelâ€™s lifecycle, a decentralized solution for this stage remains absent in the current DeAI landscape. A decentralized task-proposing platform typically requires solutions for both distributed learning algorithm preparation and decentralized code verification. The latter can offer a robust approach for DeAI by enabling objective, transparent, and efficient evaluations through consensus mechanisms, distributed validation, and reputation-based incentives. These features help address traditional verification challenges such as subjectivity, risks of collusion, and inefficiency. However, there is still a need for blockchain-enabled frameworks for decentralized code verification that can ensure both code security and operational efficiency in DeAI.</li><li><strong>Security Issues Caused by Centralized Components in DeAI</strong>: Although DeAI protocols aim for decentralization, AI model training often relies on centralized third-party services. For example, on July 2, 2024, Bittensor faced a major security breach through its Python package on PyPi. A malicious actor uploaded a compromised package disguised as a Bittensor update, containing code that stole unencrypted private keys (coldkeys) during key decryption operations. This allowed unauthorized access to usersâ€™ wallets for fund transfers. The incident highlights a critical issue: in DeAI platforms, while the underlying blockchain itself is secure, the vulnerabilities in centralized third-party tools can undermine the overall system security.</li><li><strong>Lightweight Privacy-Preserving DeAI Solutions</strong>: Our analysis of DeAI protocols shows a growing use of ZKPs for privacy, security, and integrity in decentralized ML. Examples include Vanaâ€™s proof of data contribution, OpSecâ€™s task verification, and Sertnâ€™s proof of service, illustrating ZKPs' importance. However, on-chain ZKP generation and verification still remain computationally expensive, posing scalability challenges and necessitating optimizations. While the OML project offers a promising concept of â€œAI-native cryptographyâ€, which is tailored for continuous AI data representations rather than discrete data, realizing such lightweight solutions for DeAI requires further research and innovation.</li><li><strong>Efficiency Evaluation and Scalability of DeAI</strong>: DeAI currently lacks standardized benchmarking frameworks tailored to its unique architecture, making it difficult to access and compare decentralized models' performance with advanced centralized models such as GPT and Llama. Developing robust evaluation criteria for DeAI models is an important research challenge. Moreover, the blockchain components in DeAI may introduce performance bottlenecks, especially when computations are performed on-chain. Moving heavy computations off-chain could reintroduce centralized control over critical elements of the AI pipeline, defeating blockchainâ€™s purpose. Effective scaling of DeAI requires adaptive techniques for distributed model training, efficient communication, and convergence guarantees, yet real-world implementation and validation remain challenging. Addressing these issues is essential for DeAI to achieve both high performance and true decentralization.</li><li><strong>Combining DeAI with Other Decentralized Applications</strong>: The integration of DeAI with other decentralized platforms offers promising new applications, particularly in areas such as IoT and DeFi. A notable example is PINAI, which aims to create a decentralized platform for Personal AI, prioritizing user privacy, data ownership, and crypto-economic security. PINAI builds on open-source AI, leveraging blockchain to facilitate a secure and transparent environment where AI models can access rich contextual data without compromising privacy. Additionally, DeAIâ€™s integration with DeFi platforms, such as Giza ARMA agents, Compass Labs DeFi agents, and NOYA, can enhance algorithmic trading models, while its use in decentralized data marketplaces enables data sharing and monetization. Such combinations create new opportunities for building resilient, transparent, and efficient AI-driven applications across various domains.</li></ul><h3>More about FLock</h3><p><em>At FLock, we pride ourselves as a research-driven organization, as most of our features in production originate from peer-reviewed academic work.

However, for more demanding ones, I switch to the A100 GPU due to its larger memory capacity. On the software side, I utilise LLaMA Factory and have also modified the official training node repository with custom code to suit my specific needs.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Note:</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> LLaMA Factory is a popular framework for fine-tuning large language models, offering a range of tools and techniques to optimize model performance.</span></p><h2><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Strategies for Success in AI Arena</strong></h2><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Q: How do you manage the balance between model performance and training efficiency?</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Silent666:</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> I focus on key hyperparameters, such as batch size and learning rate, to ensure that the model converges efficiently without sacrificing accuracy. It's a delicate balance that requires constant monitoring and adjustment.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Q: What strategies have you found most effective for consistently ranking higher in AI Arena tasks?</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Silent666:</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> A strong base model is key to ranking higher. I typically select models with the best performance based on the maximum parameter limits. Additionally, self-evaluation helps me fine-tune the parameters for optimal results. Consistency and continuous improvement are crucial for maintaining a high ranking.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Q: Can you share an example of a particularly challenging task you encountered and how you overcame it?</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Silent666:</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> During the final days of Task 12, I noticed that my model wasn't improving, even though other trainers were achieving significantly better scores. I realized I needed to adjust parameters I hadn't focused on before. I reduced the gradient_accumulation_steps, which in LoRA fine-tuning helps speed up convergence by applying weight updates more frequently. Along with changes to other hyperparameters, this ultimately improved my model's performance and allowed it to surpass the competition.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Note:</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique used to fine-tune large language models more efficiently by updating a small number of parameters instead of the entire model.</span></p><h2><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Importance of Data and Hyperparameter Tuning</strong></h2><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Q: How do you approach dataset preparation and preprocessing for different types of tasks?</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Silent666:</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> While I'm not deeply experienced in data processing, I often use web crawlers to gather relevant data. I also utilize AI tools to assist in formatting the data for different tasks. This approach allows me to create custom datasets tailored to each specific challenge.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Q: What role does hyperparameter tuning play in your approach, and how do you optimize it?</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Silent666:</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Hyperparameter tuning is crucial in my training approach. I carefully adjust key hyperparameters and prepare my own validation set to evaluate performance and identify the best configurations. After submitting the task and reviewing the validation score, I refine the parameters further to continuously improve the model's performance.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Q: How do you handle the potential for overfitting when trying to achieve high rankings?</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Silent666:</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> I handle the potential for overfitting by using a custom validation set to closely monitor both training and evaluation loss. In LoRA fine-tuning, overfitting can occur when training loss continues to decrease, but evaluation loss plateaus or increases. To mitigate this, I regularly evaluate the model's generalization performance and adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate or apply early stopping techniques when necessary.</span></p><h2><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Impact of FLock's Reward System and Future Outlook</strong></h2><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Q: What impact has the stake-based reward system had on your participation and strategies?</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Silent666:</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> I joined AI Arena early and participated in many tasks, which helped me accumulate more tokens to stake. The stake-based reward system motivates me to stay competitive and actively engage in new tasks to further increase my stake.

We at FLock have some very exciting news to share with you - Delegation Upgrade at our flagship AI Arena!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since our beta launch in May this year, we have received almost 1.5 million validation submissions, 16,000 training submissions, with more than 875 validators, 500 training nodes, and 70 delegators participating in AI Arena. Thank you for all your support and dedication, without which this wouldnâ€™t have been such a huge success! However, our ambition to decentralize AI does not stop here. We understand that the barriers to becoming a training node or validator remain high - it often requires a certain level of technical know-how or computational resources to participate.

Such delegation ended alongside the lifecycle of a specific task. As such, delegators were not able to withdraw until a task was finished. Also, reward share ratio which determines how much delegators are rewarded was set by FLock in smart contracts.&nbsp;</span></p><h1><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">How does it work now?</span></h1><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Now, the Delegation Upgrade comes with 4 important changes:</span></p><ol><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Delegators can now delegate $FML to both training nodes and validators, making the pool of potential candidates for delegation much bigger.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Delegation is now bound to a wallet address, not to a specific task, meaning delegation is decoupled from the lifecycle of a given task. As such, delegation to a participant will go on even after a task is finished.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Withdrawal is now simplified - delegators are now free to withdraw 1 day after delegation, even if a task has not been completed.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Training nodes and validators are now free to choose their own reward share ratio - the higher the ratio, the more reward delegators will receive when wallets delegate $FML to a given participant, thereby attracting more tokens to be delegated to this user.</span></li></ol><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In other words, delegators can pick and choose any participant in the ecosystem - doesnâ€™t matter whether the participant is a training node or a validator, nor whether the task that participant contributed to has finished.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mechanisms for joining as a training node and validator remain unchanged. You can read more about it </span><a href="https://docs.flock.io/flock-products/ai-arena" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">here</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span></p><h1><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Why is the upgrade a good thing?</span></h1><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Delegation Upgrade introduces significant improvements that benefit delegators, other participants, and the entire ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);">More Rewards and Flexibility for Delegators</span></h2><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For delegators, this means more flexibility in terms of delegation options and withdrawals. With the pool of candidates expanded to include both training nodes and validators, delegators now have more options to choose from, enabling them to spread their $FML tokens more strategically. By being able to delegate to wallet addresses rather than specific tasks, they can continue supporting the participants they trust, even after individual tasks have concluded. Also, thereâ€™s an increase in flexibility when it comes to withdrawal. These all together lead to a more dynamic and continuous delegation process, creating new opportunities to maximize rewards over an extended period.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moreover, delegators now have a greater chance of earning rewards. Since the potential pool of participants has grown, delegators can choose from a wider range of contributors within the ecosystem. This diversification not only increases the likelihood of successful participation but also allows them to better manage risk. The longer delegation period, bound to wallet addresses, ensures that the funds remain active and profitable for as long as possible, with fewer interruptions between task lifecycles.</span></p><h2><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);">Greater Earning Potentials, Control and Influence for Training Nodes &amp; Validators</span></h2><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For training nodes and validators, the upgrade means potentially more $FML flowing into their wallets. Lowering the barrier to entry for delegators leads to increased participation, and this influx of new delegators results in more staked $FML supporting them. The ability to customize reward share ratios is another critical improvement. Training nodes and validators can now compete for delegators by offering more attractive reward ratios. Those who are willing to share a larger portion of their earnings will likely attract more delegators, while others may choose to retain more of the rewards for themselves, depending on their strategy.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Additionally, having more $FML delegated to them provides significant advantages for training nodes and validators. With a larger stake, they stand to earn greater rewards from the daily emission of $FML tokens, as these rewards are distributed somewhat proportionally based on the amount of $FML staked. This not only boosts their potential earnings but also enhances their influence within the ecosystem. A higher staked amount can give them a larger say in determining the winning models amongst AI Arena tasks, thereby strengthening their position and impact on the platform.</span></p><h2><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);">A Step Closer to Decentralization</span></h2><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On a broader scale, this upgrade takes the FLock ecosystem one step closer to true decentralization. By handing over control of the reward ratio from FLock to the individual participants, weâ€™re reinforcing the decentralized nature of the platform. Now, participants can decide whatâ€™s fair and competitive, removing the top-down control previously set by FLock. The lowered barriers for entry also contribute to a more inclusive environment, allowing anyone holding $FML to participate in the delegation process. This increased participation will help foster a healthy and sustainable AI-driven ecosystem where contributions are both rewarded and valued.</span></p><h1><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">How to join?</span></h1><h2><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(67, 67, 67);">Join The Delegator Pioneers Program</span></h2><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To celebrate this milestone, weâ€™re launching the Delegator Pioneers Program to recruit the first wave of delegators as we move towards full decentralization.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To join the program, just follow these simple steps:</span></p><h3><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Join The Program: Create Your Delegator Character</strong></h3><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Head to </span><a href="https://x.com/flock_io/status/1843705010930004290ï»¿" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">https://x.com/flock_io/status/1843705010930004290</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> and create&nbsp;your own Delegator Character using Flockâ€™s custom AI model.
